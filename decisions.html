            <p class="description">
                <img src="web/images/fmp1.png" alt="VCED1"><br>
                Information technology continues to provide opportunities to alter the decision-making behavior of individuals.[1] When people have gigabytes of data accessed at their fingertips, many researches and studies negatively shows that it s harder for people to make rational decisions.[2] A research conducted by Barclays Plan & Invest in partnership with researchers at UCL reveals that Brits spend a staggering 148 minutes each day deliberating over everyday decisions - from what to wear or eat, what to watch on TV or how to tackle their to-do list. [3] 
                <br><img src="web/images/fmp2.jpg" alt="VCED2"><br>
                Despite the ubiquity of visualizations in research and practice, there is no comprehensive understanding of the potential and limits of information visualization for decision-making, where its ability to improve decision accuracy and quality has been overwhelmingly confirmed. [4] 
                <br><img src="web/images/fmp3.jpg" alt="VCED3"><br>
                Therefore, I want to try develop a systematic method of data visualization as a skill or a tool to help people estimate the complexity of decisions they encounter in daily lives. 
               </p>
               <p class="link">Audience and Outcome</p>
            <p class="description">
                <br><img src="web/images/fmp5.jpg" alt="VCED4"><br>
                Describe the data visualization method I am looking for from two perspectives:
            <br> - This project focus on the application of data visualization method in everyday situations. 
            <br> - The data of complexity itself stands as the topic in the data visualization output, which is established for the audience to explore the  micro narrative in their everyday life.
            <br><img src="web/images/fmp4.jpg" alt="VCED5"><br>
            I will conduct secondary research, questionnaire, interview and cognitive mapping research to get enough knowledge to organize the design methodology steps by steps:
            <br>- Decide on a certain scenario that fits the theme and is convenient for me to practice designing.
            <br>- Define the index (or indexes) to describe the experience of complexity in decision making.
            <br>- Scale the variables that compose the index and connect them with theoretical basis.
            <br>- Organize the visual representation of the index on charts and other creative forms.
            <br>
            After making these decisions, I will have some design prototype to proceed ----  to conduct advanced research methods of cultural probes and design workshops.
            <br><img src="web/images/fmp6.png" alt="VCED6"><br>
            The audience would be: people living in a modern society who have no professional knowledge of the professional areas involved in this topic, such as business decision-making, and who (may) encounter difficulties in daily life decision-making. In terms of situations, the audience group might focus on university students.
