            A data research report analyzed all the content related to AI in the New York Times over the past decades and counted the data of different fields, relevance, and attitudes.
            After reading the report, I extracted and collated these data and made several information charts based on them to intuitively see how the public (media) attitude changes.
            <br><br>
            The power of AI is obvious to all. Who knows when they will suddenly lose
            their jobs because of AI? And who is expecting AI to make life better?
            In any case, it is essential to pay attention.</p>

                year period in total.
                Researchers evaluate the mood level of each article with a

                The attitude of perception of the public has always been an interesting and
                valuable topic, both for researchers and viewers (even for the bystanders).
                Researchers can study on culture, society, media, and philosophy from the data, for
                topics such as what kind of events can affect people's attitudes towards what
                emotional direction. Observers can use the information to make business forecasts.
                And people who watch the activity can better understand themselves or just enjoy
                the happiness from empathy.

            This is a cooperative project with Neusoft, a leading Chinese Information Technology Services Corporation. I was invited to provide professional advice on the iterative of a digital management systems. 
            <img src="web/images/research1.png" alt="NSimg2">
            In the context of the humanistic management model, for managers, digital dashboard is no longer just data and tables, but also a storyboard that tells stories with culture to unites people. Data dashboards contain one more dimension on top of a chart that convety more complex narrative of time, space, logic, and human feelings which values more than a good-looking number.
            <img src="web/images/Output5.png" alt="NSimg3">
            I optimized the graphics and interactivity of the data dashboard based on the manager's working scenes, statistical logic in datasets, and the order of enterprise resources: Think of each chart as a window in the comic, connect them with a coherent narrative, and let the story unfold naturally according to the usage scenarios of the executive's work.
            <img src="web/images/output7.png" alt="NSimg4">
            "Revolutionary optimization solution," commented the project director, "Now our data dashboard is as vivid as a comic!"

            Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are subject to increasing levels and diversity of human activities that may severely affect environmental, scientific and historic values within its marine and terrestrial ecosystems and cryosphere. 
            <img src="web/images/research2.png" alt="PAimg3">
            As an emerging research field, plastic pollution in Antarctica has not been fully studied and has received even less social attention. Therefore, based on the suggestions of scientists, I explore this topic to disseminate some valuable information to the public.

                In 2050, Shanghai has become the largest city in east Asia,attracting hundreds of millions of foreigner to live in the city.They need to either buy new house or rent old house to live in.Under such circumstance,the light environment, as one of themost important aspect in evaluating living condition, shall have aclear and direct way to be presented to these people.
            <img src="web/images/LMimage1.JPG" alt="LMimg1">
            Following the light regulation guidebooks, I design these visualization concept in a booklet for foreigners to check out different light environments in the city.
            <img src="web/images/LMimage3.png" alt="LMimg3">
            The booklet categorizes the information by places. In addition, I also designed a series of maps to show information by different time periods in a day.

                l designed this game in order to study the media theory, of howthe medium and netizens raise public opinions, and inspire fur-ther thoughts on the new problems we are facing towards newmedias on the Internet.

            My idea came from my study on communication theory, a course l took incollege.And l want to tell a story about the media.
            After learning more of the people, the group and the mass media, l found itreallyinteresting that, the way the group of people form their opinions, the waythe leaderhaving influence and the medium platform.People live in the
            information environment composed of various mediums.They have a greatinfluence on people, but little attention is paid to them.
            lt is always the case that, the public opinion is influenced by many forces.Therefore, in order to recall the thinking of the public, my friend and ldesignedthis card game to get the useful knowledge over to them.

                ln this project, l redesigned the book"The Art of Game
                Design" to better its reading experience, and to make it betterunderstood by readers.Based on my interview and research, lfound the design defects of this book and improved them,and finally achieved the balance of functionality, beauty andrich knowledge content.
            <img src="web/images/BDimage1.png" alt="BDimg2">
            As someone who is always interested in game, l have experienced theuniqueness of design and aesthetics in games, and l have some
            understanding of game design of my own.Therefore, l want this bookto be more than just a guide book, to have the aesthetic feeling of thegood games. When reading or referring this book, I hope the designerscan feel that they are doing a special and meaningful work.

            To truly understand game design, designersmust understand a complex network composed of creativity, psychology, art, technology andbusiness,and gradually establish a complex relationship system between designers, players,games, teams and customers in mind.
