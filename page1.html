            <h3>Dataset, Visualization and Stories</h3>
        <p class="link"> Research / PERSONAL PROJECT / 2024 </p>
        <p class="description"> This is a summary of my research on data visualization, for the course uniData Visualization Tools, Datasets and Data Stories
        </p>
            <img src="web/images/statistics.jpg" alt="RSC1">
            <h3>Data Visualization Tools</h3>
        <p class="description">
            Designers raise questions. Statistic tools helps designer understand the question. And designers translate information into visual language with statistic methods.
            <br>
            Visual languages for statistics has been developed throughout history. Based on my research in different fields, I practiced demonstrating the methods of data visualization throughout the history of human beings. For example, people has been using many figures to record the flow of time.
            <img src="web/images/time1.jpg" alt="RSC2">
            <img src="web/images/time2.jpg" alt="RSC3">
            Along with the change through the embodied experience of time, languages about time has been developed across different measurement with different accuracy, charts, precisions and span.
            <br>
            JavaScript enable designers to connect our design with online resources and work with blueprints on top of the graphics. On top of that, I practiced mapping data with various geographical projections on webpage, which is part of my project outcome of the first semester.
            <img src="web/images/coding2.png" alt="RSC4">
            When it comes to complex dataset, drawing graphs as 3-d modeling provides better performance. Also, it makes the comprehension of deeper statistical information possible. The model can then be printed or crafted into physical ones
            <img src="web/images/rhino1.png" alt="RSC5">
            On 3d softwires like Rhino and Blender, blueprints that translate datasets into model parameters creates charts easily. I learnt this techniques from Architectural designers and practiced it into data visualization. 
            <br>
            Using various sensors for data collection can better restore sensual experience. I practiced using Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino to work out data recording and working programs that connected to my online server.
            <img src="web/images/physical.png" alt="RSC6">
        </p>
            <h3>Data Storytelling</h3>
        <p class="description">
            From the perspective of Narrative theory, events are the basic structure of story, marking certain distinguishable changes. A set of data can be a direct record of an event or possible relatives with a potential event. And a chart can show what happens in an event.
            <img src="web/images/event.png" alt="RSC7">
            Plots refers to the meaningful arrangement and organization of events and actions in a story. Plots forms narratives and elicit emotional responses and understanding. Common research dataset connect the events with certain variables: timeline, cause and effect, relativity, ranking……
            <img src="web/images/plot.png" alt="RSC8">
            Plots decides how I should organize the figures in my charts, and discover the knowledge, which is, for me, the most difficult part of data visualization design.
            <br>
            The narrative structure of datasets follow the data source and its context of the statistical research, making the events and plots to be meaningful as a story.
            <img src="web/images/narrative1.png" alt="RSC9">
            In the project Nigeria Decarbonization Strategy-Data Report of Clean Cooking Technology and Fuel, I practiced the narrative structure of Cinderella, telling the story of a BETTER DAY AHEAD.
            <img src="web/images/narrative2.png" alt="RSC10">
         </p>
            <h3>Understand Audience</h3>
            Data visualization on different mediums have different advantages. And the power of the medium is probably more important than the content itself----as Mr. McLuhan pointed out.
            <img src="web/images/medium.png" alt="RSC11">
            From theorists, artists, designers, data researchers to programmers, I have learnt from many influential creators in London, of their different fields of expertise. These experiences are very helpful in identifying the topic early in my projects.
            <br>
            Corresponding to the medium, the audiences for data visualization will also be differentiated. Methodologies in common design fields works as well in data visualization, such as Gestalt theories. 
            <img src="web/images/audience.png" alt="RSC12">
            Audience study in my design practice: “Nigeria Decarbonization Strategy…” : convince investors to join the energy transformation plan.
            <br>
            On top of these, data visualization  specified in segment user groups. For science workers, I would preserve more of the accurate and clear graphics. Besides, developing the humanism side of data to customize the design work is of vital importance. And of course, the first impression is always important.
            <img src="web/images/audience1.jpg" alt="RSC13">
            Just like language is complex and diverse, the expressive ability of data visualization also depends on cultural background. People with different acceptance levels of concepts such as humanity, science, statistic, data, etc. have caused great trouble to designers. 
            <br>
            Although controversial, research findings such as the one above are information that sociologists and social workers rely on. I think visualization designers can use their expertise to participate in social activities.

            A data research report analyzed all the content related to AI in the New York Times over the past decades and counted the data of different fields, relevance, and attitudes.
            After reading the report, I extracted and collated these data and made several information charts based on them to intuitively see how the public (media) attitude changes.
            <br><br>
            The power of AI is obvious to all. Who knows when they will suddenly lose
            their jobs because of AI? And who is expecting AI to make life better?
            In any case, it is essential to pay attention.</p>

                year period in total.

                The attitude of perception of the public has always been an interesting and
                valuable topic, both for researchers and viewers (even for the bystanders).
                Researchers can study on culture, society, media, and philosophy from the data, for
                topics such as what kind of events can affect people's attitudes towards what
                emotional direction. Observers can use the information to make business forecasts.
                And people who watch the activity can better understand themselves or just enjoy
                the happiness from empathy.

            <img src="web/images/research1.png" alt="NSimg2">
            In the context of the humanistic management model, for managers, digital dashboard is no longer just data and tables, but also a storyboard that tells stories with culture to unites people. Data dashboards contain one more dimension on top of a chart that convety more complex narrative of time, space, logic, and human feelings which values more than a good-looking number.
            <img src="web/images/Output5.png" alt="NSimg3">
            I optimized the graphics and interactivity of the data dashboard based on the manager's working scenes, statistical logic in datasets, and the order of enterprise resources: Think of each chart as a window in the comic, connect them with a coherent narrative, and let the story unfold naturally according to the usage scenarios of the executive's work.
            <img src="web/images/output7.png" alt="NSimg4">
            "Revolutionary optimization solution," commented the project director, "Now our data dashboard is as vivid as a comic!"

            As an emerging research field, plastic pollution in Antarctica has not been fully studied and has received even less social attention. Therefore, based on the suggestions of scientists, I explore this topic to disseminate some valuable information to the public.

                In 2050, Shanghai has become the largest city in east Asia,attracting hundreds of millions of foreigner to live in the city.They need to either buy new house or rent old house to live in.Under such circumstance,the light environment, as one of themost important aspect in evaluating living condition, shall have aclear and direct way to be presented to these people.
            <img src="web/images/LMimage1.JPG" alt="LMimg1">

            information environment composed of various mediums.They have a greatinfluence on people, but little attention is paid to them.
